# Optimization of Heating in Closed Indoor Spaces

`CL 246` - Heat Transfer Project

## Problem statement

Lowering energy consumption in large buildings by reducing the cooling load, using a thin water layer to facilitate evaporative cooling.

## [Solve](/src/)

## Results

|Outside Temperature (K)|Heat flux entering with absence of water layer (W/m^2)|Heat flux entering with water layer present (W/m^2)|
|:-:|:--:|:--:|
|305|28.5|6.0 |
|310|44.3|16.2|
|315|60.0|26.3|
|320|75.8|36.5|

The drastic reduction evident here indicates that this might be a viable method to achieve our original goal of reduction in energy and electrical costs, even accounting and/or revising for the assumptions considered.
